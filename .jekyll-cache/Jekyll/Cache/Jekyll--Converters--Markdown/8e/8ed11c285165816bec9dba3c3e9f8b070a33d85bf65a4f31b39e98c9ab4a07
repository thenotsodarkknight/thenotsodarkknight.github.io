I"±<p>So, another year of the much-dreaded JEE is over, and a new set of kids will have their faces on buses, and on papers falling off from newspapers. Another set of innocent kids, being forced to take up streams of Engineering they most likely would hate in the upcoming 4 to 5 years, due to some advice from some â€˜Sharma-ji ka betaâ€™ ( or perhaps â€˜Sharma-jiâ€™ him/her-self ) because that kid too is stuck in the same horrible stream, and wants to console himself of the choices made by him or her earlier. And another set of frustrated parents forcing their kids back to the pathetic education system they dreamt they were finally free off, just because of one screwed up exam.</p>
